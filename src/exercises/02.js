// Compound Components

import React from 'react'
import {Switch} from '../switch'

class Toggle extends React.Component {
  // you can create function components as static properties!
  // for example:
  // static Candy = (props) => <div>CANDY! {props.children}</div>
  // Then that could be used like: <Toggle.Candy />
  // This is handy because it makes the relationship between the
  // parent Toggle component and the child Candy component more explicit
  // üê® You'll need to create three such components here: On, Off, and Button
  //    The button will be responsible for rendering the <Switch /> (with the right props)
  // üí∞ Combined with changes you'll make in the `render` method, these should
  //    be able to accept `on`, `toggle`, and `children` as props.
  //    Note that they will _not_ have access to Toggle instance properties
  //    like `this.state.on` or `this.toggle`.
  static On = (props) => (props.on ? props.children : null);
  static Off = (props) => (props.on ? null : props.children);
  static Button = ({on, toggle}) => (
    <Switch on={on} onClick={toggle} />
  );

  state = {on: false};

  toggle = () =>
    this.setState(
      ({on}) => ({on: !on}),
      () => this.props.onToggle(this.state.on),
    );

  render() {
    // we're trying to let people render the components they want within the Toggle component.
    // But the On, Off, and Button components will need access to the internal `on` state as
    // well as the internal `toggle` function for them to work properly. So here we can
    // take all this.props.children and make a copy of them that has those props.
    //
    // To do this, you can use:
    // 1. React.Children.map: https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactchildrenmap
    // 2. React.cloneElement: https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#cloneelement
    //
    // üê® you'll want to completely replace the code below with the above logic.

        on: this.state.on,
        toggle: this.toggle,
      }),
    )

// Don't make changes to the Usage component. It's here to show you how your
// component is intended to be used and is used in the tests.
// You can make all the tests pass by updating the Toggle component.
